# SVG_editor

This small application was designed to schematically display the property of a building. 
The main task was to put a vector image on the floor plan of the building so that in the future it would be entered into the database of the property register of the enterprise.
On the left side there is a tool bar with the ability to prohibit or allow editing the plan of real estate objects (depending on the type of user).
In the central part, a picture is loaded as an example. The picture in the application came from the server.
In the right part of the application there is a list of objects on the plan with the implementation of drag and drop and the ability to delete and name objects.
